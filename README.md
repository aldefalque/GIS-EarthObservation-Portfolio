# GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio
# Anna-Lara Defalque-Herrberg's GIS Portfolio

🌍 Earth Observation | 🛰️ Remote Sensing | 📊 GIS Analysis 

Welcome! This is where I showcase my geospatial projects, data visualizations, and environmental observations through GIS. Projects focus on climate resilience, disaster recovery, and satellite-based spatial analysis.

## Projects
 ### Wildfire Impact in California (2012–2022)
  → Spatial analysis of county-level wildfire damage using ArcGIS Pro  
  → Tools: Dissolve, Intersect, Calculate Geometry, Summary Statistics
  
  → [View Wildfire Impact Map package](https://github.com/aldefalque/GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio/blob/main/Wildire%20Analysis%20map%20ALDefalqueHerrberg.pdf)

 ### Marbled Murrelet Suitability Analysis
  
  → A suitability analysis using ArcGIS Pro and raster data to identify potential nesting sites for the marbled murrelet in the Navarro River watershed
   
  → Techniques used: Slope, Aspect, Elevation Filtering, Raster Calculator, Zonal Geometry
  
  → **Result**: A final binary raster map and area calculations for suitable patches
  
  → [View Suitability Map PNG](https://github.com/aldefalque/GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio/blob/main/marbled-murrelet-suitability/suitability_map.png)

### Valmeyer, Illinois Relocation
  
  → A spatial analysis project using ArcGIS Pro to document the relocation of Valmeyer, Illinois, from a flood-prone area to higher ground
  
  → Techniques used: Zonal Statistics, Euclidean Distance, Slope Analysis, Feature Digitizing, Symbology, ArcGIS Online publishing
  
  → **Result**: A web map displaying updated parcel attributes (elevation, slope, distance) and a digitized road network for emergency planning
  
  → [View Valmyer relocation road-map](https://github.com/aldefalque/GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio/blob/main/moving_valmeyer_new_roads.png)

 ### 🚦 Afterschool Program Opportunities (Detroit, MI)

→ Web app comparing **historic redlining** with **current educational indicators** (school lunch eligibility, high school attainment).
→ Tools: ArcGIS Online, Instant Apps (Media Map with Swipe tool).
→ Purpose: Identify neighborhoods that would benefit most from after-school mentoring programs.
→ 🌐 [View Swipe App](https://ucirvine.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=ef12ba7fb70c4ffd9ab2170bbb68f2b7)


 ### 🌿 Ecosystem Complexity and Blue Carbon Storage (Quandamooka, QLD)
 
→ Visual representation of blue-carbon storage by vegetation type and depth.

→ Statistical analyses performed using Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn's Post-Hoc tests

→ 🌐 [View StoryMap](https://arcg.is/10n4Gn2)

→ Tools: ArcGIS Online, Instant Apps, R Studio
