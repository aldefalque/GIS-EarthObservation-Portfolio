# Anna-Lara Defalque-Herrberg's GIS Portfolio

🌍 Earth Observation | 🛰️ Remote Sensing | 📊 GIS Analysis 

Welcome! This is where I showcase my geospatial projects, data visualizations, and environmental observations through GIS. Projects focus on climate resilience, disaster recovery, and satellite-based spatial analysis.

## Projects
- **Wildfire Impact in California (2012–2022)**  
  → Spatial analysis of county-level wildfire damage using ArcGIS Pro  
  → Tools: Dissolve, Intersect, Calculate Geometry, Summary Statistics  
  → [View Wildfire Impact Map package](https://github.com/aldefalque/GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio/blob/main/Wildire%20Analysis%20map%20ALDefalqueHerrberg.pdf)

- **Marbled Murrelet Suitability Analysis**
  → A suitability analysis using ArcGIS Pro and raster data to identify potential nesting sites for the marbled murrelet in the Navarro River watershed.
  → Techniques used: Slope, Aspect, Elevation Filtering, Raster Calculator, Zonal Geometry.  
  → **Result**: A final binary raster map and area calculations for suitable patches.
  → [Open Suitability Map PNG](https://github.com/aldefalque/GIS-EarthObservation-Portfolio/blob/main/marbled-murrelet-suitability/suitability_map.png)

  
- **Upcoming projects:**
  → **Urban heat mapping with Landsat**
  → **Deforestation in the Congo Basin**
  → **Impact mapping of coral Bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef and geoengineering implementations**
  → **AI-Assisted Obstacle Detection Ground Truthing for Railway Systems in Senegal**
